**We do not collect any personal information.**

OrbitWall is designed to work without collecting, storing, or transmitting any personal data about you.

## Permissions Used

Our app requires the following permissions:

- **Internet Permission**: Required to load satellite imagery tiles from public mapping services. We do not track or log your internet usage.

## How We Use Information

Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no information to use, share, or sell.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Third-Party Services

OrbitWall uses public satellite imagery services (such as ESRI ArcGIS) to display map tiles. These services may have their own privacy policies. We do not control these third-party services.

## Data Security

- All data (saved wallpapers) is stored locally on your device
- We use HTTPS for all network requests
- We do not maintain any servers or databases

## Children's Privacy

Our app is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13, and since we don't collect any information, this is not applicable.
